  <div class= "body"> <p> <pre> There are many statistical and logical reasons, for why Lebron James is a better basketball player than the famous Michael Jordan. 2-point shooting: LeBron James
A word of warning — if you hate math, you're not going to like some of these arguments.

Facts win here in the real world, though, where LeBron is simply a better scorer inside the arc than Jordan, making 54.3 percent of his 2-point attempts compared to MJ's 51.0 percent. 

There are qualitative arguments in Jordan's favor, sure. He was better at making difficult shots, he took more attempts, so his percentage was naturally a little lower, and modern defenders can't try to limit LeBron with the hand-check.

But Jordan's contemporaries couldn't zone him up and ignore his teammates, either, so the numbers don't lie.

  3-point shooting: LeBron James
Not even the biggest Jordan fan can argue for MJ on this one.

Jordan was a career 32.7 percent shooter from deep on 1.7 attempts per game (to LeBron's 34.2 percent on 4.0 attempts), and His Airness received an assist from the NBA's decision to move the 3-point line in to 22 feet all the way around
 the arc for his 1995-96 and 1996-97 seasons.

Scoring efficiency: LeBron James
Even with his free-throw shooting woes, LeBron has a higher true shooting percentage (58.4 to 56.9 percent), and he trails MJ's career PER of 27.9 by just 0.3 points despite averaging three fewer points per game for his career.

Suffice it to say that if LeBron wanted to be more of a scorer, instead of a playmaker, he could average Jordan-esque scoring totals.

Rebounding: LeBron James
The bigger man is obviously a better rebounder, and though LeBron's 7.3 rebounds per game might not seem to stack up that well with Jordan's 6.2, remember that the NBA played at a quicker pace during MJ's prime. Per 100 possessions, LeBron averages 9.8 boards,
 compared to Jordan's 8.3 (which is still an impressive number for his 6-foot-6 Airness).

Defense: LeBron James
Jordan was a more tenacious defender for his position, and he excelled at shutting down opponents one-on-one. He also had Scottie Pippen to take on the toughest defensive challenges.

At his best, LeBron can guard all five positions, and he has a Kevin Garnett-esque ability to direct his teammates to eliminate any possible threat. That advantage as a team defender gives LeBron a slight edge.

NBA Finals appearances and playoffs
Jordan never made it to more than three NBA Finals in a row,
 while Lebron has made it to a mind-boggling seven straight and counting. Throw in the fact that Jordan didn’t make it out of the first round of the playoffs until his fourth attempt and Lebron has never lost in the first round.
 You can say that Jordan’s Bulls lost to Bird’s Celtics on two of those occasions, but they also lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in the other. Meanwhile, people don’t give Lebron a break for losing this year to a loaded Warriors team in the playoffs, either.
WHY PEOPLE DISAGREE: Many people tend to disagree with the statement that Lebron is better than Jordan. The reason for this is because mainly,
 Jordan was a better point scorer than Lebron, and was considered a more clutch player with more game winning shots statistically. In our call to action, we will prove why this doesn’t make Jordan a better player.

CALL TO ACTION: Although Jordan was a more clutch and aggressive scorer, we know that scoring ability is not all it takes to be an all around great player on the court.
 Lebron is one of the top scorers of all time, with the addition of defensive and team assisting attributes such as passing, rebounding, leadership during tough positions,
 and defensive IQ, all of which Lebron excelled at through his stats, as you can see on our Lebron page. What people should now do with this information is that they should now seriously consider ranking Lebron over Michael Jordan and 
 put an end to the “Lebron-Jordan” rivalry, as Lebron is clearly a more well rounded player in most categories.
